immutable - not able to be changed
mutable - able to be changed
strings- is a type of class in python
if -when a condition is met, execute the following code
elif - if preceding if or elif condition result do not execute, and this condition is met, then execute
else -  default conditions, execute the following code
list - mutable, ordered, denoted by square brackets []
tuple - immutable, ordered, denoted by () and commas, more performance
set - mutable, unordered, denoted by {} curly brackets
for loop - block of code that is executed over the number of items specified in a sequence (an iterable)
while - block of code that is repeated while certain conditions are met, true, if false it won't execute
interpolation - when add valid python code into a string
function- reusable code, easily access chunks of code
dictionary -  a mutable, unordered set of key/value pairs denoted by curly brackets{}
encapsulate -can move block around because encapsulated/contained
argument - an argument is what you use to give/pass into a function
parameter - is what you ask for in a function definition
function - named, reusable block of code; that can take in parameters and returns information.  Functions are "envoked"
scope - a bounded region that contains local information, but can access information from it's parent scope (bad practice)
return - data that is passed back from a function.  None is the default return if no other return is specified.
code block - a region of code that is similarly indented (id'd by prior colon)
\n new line, \t tab, \s escape
procedure - sequential steps you take performing actions
encapsulation - bundling data and methods into one unit.  Data is encapsulated by functions that manipulate that data.
number data types - integer, float and compex
list, tuple, set, dictionary - way to collect a group of data into a single variable

#                   Collections
# Type          Mutable     Ordered     Denotation
# ------------------------------------------------
# List          Yes         Yes         [,]             A list is a class
# Set           Yes         No          {,}             Also class, all unique
# Tuple         No          Yes         (,)             Can "unpack" when declare
# Dictionary    Yes         No          { KEY : VALUE, } .get is a method, keys unique

* Can put anything inside of these

class - Custom blueprint for a Python object
instance - An individual object in Python, what a class creates when initialized
self - Refers to this instance of an object within that object, how you access
 individual instances when modifying data on an instance.
attribute - A data value that is stored on an instance or class
method - A function that exists on class instances, usually helps modify 
or get data from the object.
Inheritance - When one class inherits methods and attributes from a parent class.
Polymorphism - Methods with the same name that perform different operations 
based on what the method is called on.
Abstraction- The act of stepping away from the intricate details and only 
dealing with the input and output of a procedure
Encapsulation - Bundling data and functions that manipulate that data 
together into a single module
Return - The ability to pass data from inside of the function and terminate 
the function as well
Floats- positive or negative rational numbers
Method Overriding - When a class inherits from another, re-defining 
a method from the parent inside of the child to perform a different 
task than originally intended.
Interpolation - Insertion of data into a string to create a modular 
template of a resulting string
Attribute - a data value that is stored on an instance or class.
Big O notation - order of magnitude
